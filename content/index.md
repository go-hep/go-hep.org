`go-hep` is a set of libraries and applications allowing High Energy Physicists to write efficient analysis code in the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language.


[Go](https://golang.org) brings the fast edit-compile-run cycle that interpreted language users know and the runtime efficiency that compiled languages users expect.
[go-hep](https://go-hep.org) provides the needed `HEP` oriented packages on top of this concurrency-enabled language.
 
`go-hep` currently sports the following packages:

- [go-hep.org/x/fads](https://go-hep.org/x/fads): a fast detector simulation toolkit
- [go-hep.org/x/fastjet](https://go-hep.org/x/fastjet): a jet clustering algorithms package (WIP)
- [go-hep.org/x/fmom](https://go-hep.org/x/fmom): a 4-vectors library
- [go-hep.org/x/fwk](https://go-hep.org/x/fwk): a concurrency-enabled framework
- [go-hep.org/x/hbook](https://go-hep.org/x/hbook): histograms and n-tuples (WIP)
- [go-hep.org/x/hplot](https://go-hep.org/x/hplot): interactive plotting (WIP)
- [go-hep.org/x/hepmc](https://go-hep.org/x/hepmc): `HepMC` in pure [Go](https://golang.org) (EDM + I/O)
- [go-hep.org/x/hepevt](https://go-hep.org/x/hepevt): `HEPEVT` bindings
- [go-hep.org/x/heppdt](https://go-hep.org/x/heppdt): `HEP` particle data table
- [go-hep.org/x/lhef](https://go-hep.org/x/lhef): Les Houches Event File format
- [go-hep.org/x/croot](https://go-hep.org/x/croot): bindings to a subset of [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) I/O
- [go-hep.org/x/rio](https://go-hep.org/x/rio): `go-hep` record oriented I/O
- [go-hep.org/x/sio](https://go-hep.org/x/sio): `LCIO` I/O
- [go-hep.org/x/slha](https://go-hep.org/x/slha): `SUSY` Les Houches Accord I/O

## Installation

`go-hep` packages are installable via the `go get` command:

```sh
$ go get go-hep.org/x/fads
```

Just select the package you are interested in and `go get` will take care of fetching, building and installing it, as well as its dependencies, recursively.

`go-hep` is available on all [Go](https://golang.org) supported platforms, mainly:

- `linux-{amd64,386,arm,arm64,mips,mips32,...}`
- `darwin-{amd64,386,...}`
- `windows-{amd64,386,...}`
- `freebsd-{amd64,386,...}`
