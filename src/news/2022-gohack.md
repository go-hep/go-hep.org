[GoHACK Devpost](https://gohack.devpost.com/) is *LIVE!*


[Google](https://google.com) and [CERN](https://home.cern) are teaming up to host a [Go](https://golang.org) hackathon and improve scientific applications or libraries written in [Go](https://golang.org).

Either working on general scientific apps/libs, or working on 3 [CERN](https://home.cern)-related applications or libraries:

- [Reva](https://reva.link/): a gRPC server written in Go to provide interoperability between different storage and applications,
- [Golbd](https://github.com/cernops/golbd): a DNS load balancer written in Go to efficiently manage the thousands of computer nodes in the CERN Computer Center,
- [Go-HEP](https://go-hep.org)

More informations about the hackathon are available here:

Don't hesitate to spread the word.

In preparation for this hackathon, we have setup 3 projects (they are
but suggestions):

- `groot-rntuple` (adding support for ROOT-7 `RNTuple` file format)
  https://github.com/go-hep/hep/projects/5

- `groot-member-wise-streaming` (adding support for reading/writing member-wise objects)
  https://github.com/go-hep/hep/projects/6

- `hplot-zoom-pan` (adding support for plot interactivity in `hplot`: zoom/pan with mouse+wheel, on top of `gonum/plot/vg/vggio`)
  https://github.com/go-hep/hep/projects/7

Let the fun begin!
